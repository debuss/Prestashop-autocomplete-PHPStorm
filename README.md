# PrestaShop autocomplete for PHPStorm

This code completion is for people developing PrestaShop modules in PHPStorm **without having PrestaShop as a project root**.
For example, I have PrestaShop on my local server and my modules are located on DropBox, I then create a symbolic link from my modules to the "modules" folder of PrestaShop.
Then in PHPStorm I have the module folder as a root project.

**If you have PrestaShop as a root project, you can use the completion of [dkarvounaris](https://github.com/dkarvounaris/PHPStorm-CC-PrestaShop) or [julienbourdeau](https://github.com/julienbourdeau/PhpStorm-PrestaShop-Autocomplete).**
